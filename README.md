# Intro
New Dex was planned to be a debugging suite. Only the Explorer part is completed, probably nothing else will be.

It was discontinued more than a year ago, might as well just release.
	
This is the final version of this script.
You are encouraged to edit, fork, do whatever with this. I pretty much won't be updating it anymore.
Though I would highly appreciate it if you kept the credits in the script. I put a lot of hours into this during the time I worked on it.

I have converted this from ModuleScript format (I used to develop this in studio) to a file format, to make it easier for whoever wants to continue or edit this.

## Notes
- There is no cloneref protection, add it if you want
- Some stuff can be optimized further, it's up to you if you want to do it
- It may be detected by more stuff; I don't know what these detections are nor am I interested in fixing it

## To Build
1. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
2. Run build.py

## High Level Roadmap
List of stuff that I planned do before I realized that I shouldn't be working on this anymore.
- Terminal (basically command interface with useful commands (non troll or gross) to get around)
- 

## Missing stuff from old Dex
Features that existed in old Dex that I didn't get to make. These should be the first things you add if you plan to continue / edit this.
- Click to select
- Saving (instance specific in right click menu, and a menu for whole map saving)
- Settings menu
- Tabs in script viewer
